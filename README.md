## Why I'm Focusing on Rust for Backend Development

Having worked with C, I’ve come to appreciate the challenges and intricacies of low-level memory management. Rust offers an exciting opportunity to explore new concepts that prevent typical memory issues found in C, such as null pointer dereferencing and data races. This makes it an ideal language for building high-performance, safe backend systems.

Additionally, Rust complements my Python skills by providing a compiled language to my toolkit. While Python is fantastic for rapid development and scripting, Rust enables me to write systems with better control over performance and memory, which is crucial in backend development. Learning Rust is a great way to expand my capabilities and tackle more performance-critical challenges.

To deepen my understanding, I’m working through the "Zero to Production in Rust" book. This practical guide helps me build production-ready backend services with Rust, providing hands-on experience with key concepts like web servers, databases, and concurrency. It’s the perfect resource to apply Rust’s safety and performance features in real-world projects.
